What would you like to see in Vim for Windows?


= Details =

== Win64 ==

  * Support for Ruby, TCL, MzScheme, etc interfaces. This requires the owners of these languages to produce 64-bit builds.

== Console ==

  * Full support for Unicode and UTF-8

== Misc ==

  * Shell/pty support. Look at [http://www.wana.at/vimshell/ VIM-Shell], [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1974 PyConsole], and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/ Console]
  * Visual Studio integration for VS 200x. VisVim only works for VS98 (VC6). Look at [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=864 Visual Studio].
  * Omni-completion for C# and other .NET languages. Steal intellisense stuff from [http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/ SharpDevelop]?

== Performance ==

This should be of general benefit to Vim on all platforms.

  * Profile start-up times
  * Profile heavyweight operations. For example, [http://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.html VST] takes about 1 minute to regenerate its own documentation, running at 100% CPU.
